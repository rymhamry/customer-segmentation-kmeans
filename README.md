# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies unsupervised machine learning (K-Means) to segment mall customers by income and spending habits. The goal is to discover actionable clusters for targeted marketing and customer strategy.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Power BI for interactive dashboard
- Google Colab for notebook

## 📁 Files Included
- `Mall_Customers.ipynb`: Cleaned notebook with full code and explanation
- `Customer_Segmentation_Report.pdf`: Final PDF report with visuals
- `PowerBI_Dashboard.png`: Sample view of the final dashboard
- `Mall_Customers_Clustered.csv`: Dataset with cluster labels

## 📊 Results
The K-Means algorithm identified 5 customer segments. Insights were visualized with both Python plots and a Power BI dashboard.
